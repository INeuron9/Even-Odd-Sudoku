# Even-Odd-Sudoku
Sudoku but a twist. Specific blocks are marked as even or odd.

**Project Overview**

Even-Odd Sudoku is an enhanced version of the traditional Sudoku puzzle game that introduces a unique twist: no two consecutive numbers in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid can share the same parity (odd or even). The game is implemented using Python and the Pygame library for the user interface, while backtracking and constraint satisfaction algorithms solve the puzzle.
